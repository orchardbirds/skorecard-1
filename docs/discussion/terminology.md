`prebucketing`
:  First dividing an array into a smaller set of buckets (bins) before finding the final set of buckets. For example, an array containing 10.000 unique values might first be prebucketed into 100 prebuckets and then bucketed into 10. This makes the process of finding the final 10 buckets slightly easier, because there are less possible boundaries.
